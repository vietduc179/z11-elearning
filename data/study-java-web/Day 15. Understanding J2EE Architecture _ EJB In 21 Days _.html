Enterprise  applications can be assembled from standard components and then deployed on  varieties of J2EE-compliant application servers. Today, you’ll explore the big  picture of the J2EE platform. We’ll cover the rationale behind the Java 2  Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE), and the set of standard APIs that  constitute its framework. You’ll study the evolution of the multitier  architecture as the basis for the J2EE platform. By the end of the day, you’ll  have learned how your projects can benefit from the J2EE design patterns. You’ll  also learn how J2EE applications are deployed in the appropriate container.</p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title">J2EE Overview</h3>
<p class="docText">Java is one of the most commonly used and mature programming  languages for building enterprise applications. Over the years, Java development  has evolved from small applets run on a Web browser to large enterprise  distributed applications run on multiple servers. Now, Java has three different  platforms, or flavors, and each addresses certain programming requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="docList">The Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE) is the underlying  base platform for the J2EE. Therefore, a brief discussion on the J2SE platform  is relevant to our discussion of the J2EE platform. The J2SE platform consists  of the Java 2 Software Development Kit (SDK) and the Java 2 Runtime Environment  (JRE). J2SE includes tools and application programming interfaces (APIs) for  developing client applications with graphical user interfaces (GUIs), database  access, directory access, Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA),  fine-grained security, input/output functions, and many other functions. It’s  the most widely used Java platform.<a name="idd1e41257"></a><a name="idd1e41262"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="docList">The Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE) is a platform  for building server-side components and applications. It provides the  infrastructure needed for these applications through a set of common  services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="docList">The Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition (J2ME) helps with building  Java applications for micro-devices with limited display and memory requirements  (the entire API fits into 1KB), such as wireless devices, PDAs, and network  devices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="docText">Today, our focus is on the J2EE platform and its common  services offerings.</p>
<p class="docText">J2EE is a platform and an industry-accepted standard that  enables solutions for developing and deploying multitier enterprise  applications. It provides a unified platform for building distributed,  server-centric systems. J2EE is a set of standard APIs that is offered by a  vendor through products and tools to be used by the enterprise. It was developed  to meet recent enterprise requirements, such as diversity of both applications  and data, in addition to the complexity of business processes. The J2EE standard  is defined through a set of related specifications, such as the J2EE  specification, the Enterprise JavaBeans specification, the Java Servlet  specification, and the JavaServer Pages (JSP) specification.<a name="idd1e41287"></a><a name="idd1e41292"></a></p>
<p class="docText">The J2EE platform offers the following benefits to the  enterprise and to product vendors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="docList">Establishes standards for database connectivity, Web  components, business logic components, message-oriented middleware (MOM),  communication protocols, and interoperability.<a name="idd1e41309"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="docList">Provides a standard for avoiding vendor lock-in and building  portable applications and components that are flexible, expandable, and  reliable. This also helps in developing secure, scalable, and transactional  applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="docList">Decreases time-to-market because much of the infrastructure and  common services are provided by vendors’ products that are implemented according  to the standard J2EE specification. IT organizations can get out of the  middleware business and concentrate on building applications for their  business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="docList">Increases developer productivity because Java programmers can  relatively easily learn J2EE technologies based on the Java language. All  enterprise software development can be accomplished under the J2EE platform,  using Java as the programming language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="docList">Promotes interoperability within existing heterogeneous  systems, such as CORBA and J2EE.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="docList">Enables developers to focus on supporting business process  requirements rather than building the in-house application infrastructure. The  application server handles the complex tasks of multithreading, synchronization,  transactions, resource allocation, and life cycle management.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="docText">In general, the J2EE platform helps the enterprise to overcome  certain issues such as programming productivity, application reliability,  availability, security, scalability, and integration with existing  systems.</p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title">The Evolution of J2EE Architecture</h3>
<p class="docText">The client/server application architecture, which was a  two-tier architecture, evolved over time to a multitier architecture. This  natural progression occurred as additional tiers were introduced between the  end-user clients and back-end systems. Although a multitier architecture brings  greater flexibility of design, it also increases the complexity of building,  testing, deploying, administering, and maintaining application components.<a name="idd1e41347"></a><a name="idd1e41350"></a></p>
<p class="docText">In the next few sections, we’ll discuss the evolution of the  multitier architecture.</p>
<p><a name="ch15lev2sec1"></a></p>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Two-Tier Architecture</h4>
<p class="docText">The two-tier architecture is also known as the client/server  architecture. It consists mainly of two tiers: data and client (GUI). The  application logic can be located in either the client tier, which results in a  fat client, or located in the data tier, which results in a fat server (see <a class="docLink" href="https://ejbvn.wordpress.com/category/week-3-advanced-ejb-applications/day-15-understanding-j2ee-architecture/#ch15fig01">Figure 15.1</a>).<a name="idd1e41372"></a><a name="idd1e41375"></a></p>
<h5 class="docFigureTitle"><a name="ch15fig01"></a>Figure 15.1. Two-tier  architecture.</h5>
<p class="docText"><a href="https://ejbvn.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/151.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="165" data-permalink="https://ejbvn.wordpress.com/2008/11/02/day-15-understanding-j2ee-architecture/attachment/151/" data-orig-file="https://ejbvn.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/151.jpg?w=529" data-orig-size="" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="[]" data-image-title="151" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://ejbvn.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/151.jpg?w=529?w=300" data-large-file="https://ejbvn.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/151.jpg?w=529?w=529" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-165" title="151" src="./Day 15. Understanding J2EE Architecture _ EJB In 21 Days __files/151.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p class="docText">This type of architecture suffers from a lack of scalability  because both the client and the server have limited resources, in addition to  the negative effect of network traffic to transfer data to the fat client.  Another issue is maintainability; you have to roll out the new system version to  all system users.</p>
<p><a name="ch15lev2sec2"></a></p>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Three-Tier Architecture</h4>
<p class="docText">To address the issues of the two-tier architecture, the  application logic will be placed in its own tier. Thus applications can be  portioned into three tiers. The first tier is referred to as the <span class="docEmphasis">presentation layer</span>, and consists of the application  GUI. The middle tier, or the <span class="docEmphasis">business layer</span>,  consists of the business logic to retrieve data for the user requests. The  back-end tier, or <span class="docEmphasis">data layer</span>, consists of the  data needed by the application. <a class="docLink" href="https://ejbvn.wordpress.com/category/week-3-advanced-ejb-applications/day-15-understanding-j2ee-architecture/#ch15fig02">Figure  15.2</a> illustrates the three-tier architecture.<a name="idd1e41411"></a><a name="idd1e41414"></a><a name="idd1e41419"></a><a name="idd1e41422"></a><a name="idd1e41425"></a><a name="idd1e41428"></a></p>
<h5 class="docFigureTitle"><a name="ch15fig02"></a>Figure 15.2. Three-tier  architecture.</h5>
<p class="docText"><a href="https://ejbvn.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/152.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="166" data-permalink="https://ejbvn.wordpress.com/2008/11/02/day-15-understanding-j2ee-architecture/attachment/152/" data-orig-file="https://ejbvn.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/152.jpg?w=529" data-orig-size="" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="[]" data-image-title="152" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://ejbvn.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/152.jpg?w=529?w=300" data-large-file="https://ejbvn.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/152.jpg?w=529?w=529" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-166" title="152" src="./Day 15. Understanding J2EE Architecture _ EJB In 21 Days __files/152.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p class="docText">The decoupling of application logic from either presentation or  data increases the flexibility of the application design. Multiple views or a  GUI can be added without changing the existing application logic. Similarly,  multiple applications can be created using the same data model. Changing the  components of one tier should not impact the other two tiers. For example, any  change to the data or GUI will not affect the application logic.</p>
<p><a name="ch15note01"></a></p>
<div class="docNote">
<p class="docNoteTitle">Note</p>
<p class="docText">The three-tier architecture is the basis for J2EE applications,  in which EJBs provide a mechanism to build application logic, while JSPs and  servlets abstract the presentation layer and allow interaction with the business  layer.<a name="idd1e41457"></a></p>
</div>
<p class="docText">One important feature of the three-tier architecture is sharing  system resources by all clients, which results in highly efficient, scalable,  secure, and reliable applications.</p>
<p><a name="ch15lev2sec3"></a></p>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Multitier J2EE Architecture</h4>
<p class="docText">Multitier (or <span class="docEmphasis">n</span>-tier)  architecture differs from the three-tier architecture in viewing each tier  logically rather than physically. The application logic, for example, can be  split into more than one layer; the business logic tier and the presentation  logic tier. Similarly, the user interface is partitioned into the client tier  and the presentation tier. A multitier architecture determines where the  software components that make up a computing system are executed in relation to  each other and to the hardware, network, and users.<a name="idd1e41475"></a><a name="idd1e41480"></a></p>
<p class="docText">J2EE is a multitier architecture, which partitions the  application into client, presentation logic, business logic, and enterprise  information tiers. <a class="docLink" href="https://ejbvn.wordpress.com/category/week-3-advanced-ejb-applications/day-15-understanding-j2ee-architecture/#ch15fig03">Figure 15.3</a> depicts  the J2EE as a multitier architecture.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphRoman">Client tier—</span> This tier  interacts with the user and displays information from the system to the user.  J2EE supports different types of clients—both inside and outside enterprise  firewalls—including Web clients (HTML and Java applets) and Java  applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphRoman">Web tier—</span> This tier accepts  user requests and generates responses using the presentation logic. In the J2EE  platform, servlets and JSPs in a Web container implement this tier, as explained  on <a class="docLink" href="https://ejbvn.wordpress.com/category/week-3-advanced-ejb-applications/day-15-understanding-j2ee-architecture/0672324237_ch07.html#ch07">Day 7</a>, “Designing Web  Applications.”<a name="idd1e41541"></a><a name="idd1e41546"></a></p>

<div class="docNote">
<p class="docNoteTitle">Note</p>
<p class="docText">The J2EE platform is designed not only to support a multitier  architecture to partition applications, but also to provide infrastructure  common services to reduce the complexity of developing and deploying these  applications.</p>
</div>
<p class="docText">Other than multitier, the J2EE architecture provides the  enterprise with common infrastructure services which help in developing and  deploying portable, secure and transactional applications. The J2EE architecture  partitions enterprise applications into three fundamental parts: components,  containers, and connectors. Components are the key focus of application  developers, whereas system vendors implement containers and connectors to hide  complexity and enhance portability. Enterprise Java applications can run on any  J2EE-compliant application server.</p>
<p><a name="ch15note03"></a></p>
<div class="docNote">
<p class="docNoteTitle">Note</p>
<p class="docText">Multitier distributed applications follow the  Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm, discussed earlier on <a class="docLink" href="https://ejbvn.wordpress.com/category/week-3-advanced-ejb-applications/day-15-understanding-j2ee-architecture/0672324237_ch01.html#ch01">Days 1</a> and <a class="docLink" href="https://ejbvn.wordpress.com/category/week-3-advanced-ejb-applications/day-15-understanding-j2ee-architecture/0672324237_ch07.html#ch07">7</a>. This design pattern provides clean  separation between tiers. Using this paradigm, the model (data tier) is  separated from the view (client and presentation tiers). Similarly, the  controller (the application logic tier) is separated from both the view and the  model.<a name="idd1e41631"></a></p>
</div>
<p class="docText">Containers transparently provide common services, including  transaction, security, persistence, and resource pooling, to both clients and  components. A container allows the configuration of applications and components  at deployment, rather than hard-coding them in program code. Connectors extend  the J2EE platform by defining a portable client service API to plug into  existing enterprise vendor products. Connectors promote flexibility by enabling  a variety of implementations of specific services.</p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title">Understanding the J2EE Container Model</h3>
<p class="docText">Containers are vital to J2EE components. Containers are the  run-time environments that provide standard common services to the deployed  components. Containers are implemented and offered by various vendors in the  form of J2EE-compliant Application Servers. Containers also provide unified  access to enterprise information systems, such as access to relational data  through the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API, or to legacy systems through  J2EE Connector Architecture (JCA) API. In addition, containers provide a  declarative mechanism for configuring applications and components at assembly or  deployment time through the use of deployment descriptors. Features that can be  configured at deployment time include security authorization and validation,  transaction management, and other tasks. <a class="docLink" href="https://ejbvn.wordpress.com/category/week-3-advanced-ejb-applications/day-15-understanding-j2ee-architecture/#ch15fig04">Figure 15.4</a> depicts the J2EE container model.<a name="idd1e41663"></a><a name="idd1e41668"></a><a name="idd1e41673"></a></p>

Understanding J2EE Architecture _ EJB In 21 Days __files/154.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p class="docText">Each tier of the J2EE architecture may consist of more than one  container. For example, the Web tier may consist of a servlet container (or  engine) and a JSP container, which together make a Web container. Similarly,  each EJB type runs on its own container, which is commonly known as an EJB  container. Some Application Servers are offered with both a Web container and an  EJB container.</p>
<p><a name="ch15note04"></a></p>
<div class="docNote">
<p class="docNoteTitle">Note</p>
<p class="docText">Some Application Servers, such as WebLogic Server, run all the  Web components in the Web container, which is different from the proxy server  that’s used as a gateway to pass requests and responses. All requests are  processed in the Web container using servlets and JSPs.</p>
</div>
<p class="docText">A Java Application Server is a platform for developing and  deploying multitier distributed J2EE-compiant enterprise applications. It  centralizes application services such as Web server functionality, business  components, and access to back-end enterprise systems. It uses technologies such  as caching and connection pooling to enhance resource utilization and  application performance. An Application Server also provides control over  performance, transaction, security, scalability, and reliability. Application  Servers provide infrastructure support to an enterprise, which not only reduces  the cost of its applications, but also reduces the time-to-market. Each  Application Server has its own advantages and disadvantages.<a name="idd1e41711"></a></p>
<p><a name="ch15note05"></a></p>
<div class="docNote">
<p class="docNoteTitle">Note</p>
<p class="docText">No two Application Servers are completely alike. There are many  factors in selecting the appropriate Application Server that fits your  enterprise needs. Some of those factors are performance, scalability, and  J2EE-compliance. Some Application Servers are based on Java, CORBA, or different  languages.</p>
</div>
<p class="docText">The following sections discuss each container used in the J2EE  multitier architecture.</p>
<p><a name="ch15lev2sec4"></a></p>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Applet Container (Web Browser)</h4>
<p class="docText">Web browsers are standard clients for e-commerce applications.  Web-based applications built with standard Web technologies are flexible,  maintainable, and portable. In Web-based applications, the user interface is  represented by HTML documents, images, form fields, and Java applets. The Web  browser contains the logic to render the Web page on the user’s computer from  the HTML description.<a name="idd1e41741"></a><a name="idd1e41746"></a></p>
<p><a name="ch15lev2sec5"></a></p>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">J2EE Client Application Container</h4>
<p class="docText">This is a Java client program that cannot run on a Web browser,  and must supply its own code for rendering the user interface. Nonbrowser  clients usually provide their own presentation and rendering logic. They depend  on the Application Server for business logic and access to back-end services.  They are more difficult to develop and deploy than Web-based clients. Any client  applications written in Java can use an Application Server’s common service over  RMI (Remote Method Invocation).<a name="idd1e41761"></a><a name="idd1e41766"></a><a name="idd1e41769"></a></p>
<p class="docText">RMI allows a client program to execute methods on an  Application Server object the same way it does locally. Java applications can  use the Java Swing classes to create powerful, portable, and sophisticated user  interfaces. Java applications can be used effectively in the enterprise behind  firewalls to avoid network issues. They can be integrated with CORBA-based  applications by using the RMI/IIOP (Internet Inter-ORB Protocol) protocol.</p>
<p><a name="ch15lev2sec6"></a></p>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Web Container</h4>
<p class="docText">Web containers provide runtime support for responding to HTTP  requests. They process requests by invoking JSP pages or a servlet, and  returning results to the client. In addition, Web containers provide APIs to  support user session management. Servlet containers and JSP containers, which  collectively are called <span class="docEmphasis">Web containers</span>, host Web  components. You learned about Web containers on <a class="docLink" href="https://ejbvn.wordpress.com/category/week-3-advanced-ejb-applications/day-15-understanding-j2ee-architecture/0672324237_ch07.html#ch07">Day 7</a>.<a name="idd1e41814"></a><a name="idd1e41819"></a></p>
<p><a name="ch15lev2sec7"></a></p>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">EJB Container</h4>
<p class="docText">As you learned on <a class="docLink" href="https://ejbvn.wordpress.com/category/week-3-advanced-ejb-applications/day-15-understanding-j2ee-architecture/0672324237_ch01.html#ch01">Day 1</a>, EJB containers host EJB components.  EJB containers provide automated support for transaction, security, persistence,  and life cycle management of deployed components. EJBs are the business logic  components for J2EE applications.<a name="idd1e41846"></a><a name="idd1e41851"></a></p>
<p><a name="ch15lev2sec8"></a></p>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Clustering of J2EE Components and Services</h4>
<p class="docText">An Application Server cluster is a group of Application Server  instances that work together to provide scalable and reliable J2EE applications.  A cluster of servers is transparent to its clients and perceived as a single  server in delivering its consolidated services. The major two capabilities that  a cluster provides are load balancing, and fail-over. Load balancing provide  services that result in higher application scalability, while fail-over enhances  the reliability and availability of the running applications.<a name="idd1e41863"></a><a name="idd1e41868"></a></p>
<p class="docText">All instances (also called <span class="docEmphasis">nodes</span> or <span class="docEmphasis">members</span>) of a cluster work together by  replicating all components and services across them. Not all components and  common services can be clustered. Each Application Server product provides  unique capabilities for clustering objects. Should one member of a cluster  fails, another member takes over the load to preserve the running services. This  increases the availability of the application to its users.<a name="idd1e41882"></a><a name="idd1e41885"></a><a name="idd1e41888"></a></p>
<p class="docText">Not all J2EE components and services are suitable for  clustering. Some types of EJB, such as stateless session beans, read-only entity  beans are highly clusterable objects, and can always be clustered. Services such  as JMS and JNDI are suitable for clustering. On the other hand, great care must  be provided when clustering stateful session beans, which are clustered using  in-memory replication to provide failover. In-memory replication of state is a  technique used to have multiple instances (called <span class="docEmphasis">replicas</span>) of the same component deployed across  different nodes of the cluster. This is more efficient than replication done  using persistence through the database. Read-write entity beans are always  anchored to one member of the cluster on which they are instantiated. If this  member fails, the application responsibility has to create a new instance.<a name="idd1e41908"></a><a name="idd1e41913"></a></p>
<p class="docText">JDBC connection pools can be clustered across multiple servers  in an Application Server environment. When a client requests a connection from  the pool, the cluster selects the server that will provide the connection,  allowing load balancing and protection against server failure. After a client  has a connection, the state maintained by the JDBC driver makes it necessary to  pin the client to the host Application Server.<a name="idd1e41926"></a></p>
<p class="docText">Java Message Service (JMS) objects also can be clustered among  the different members of a cluster. Both JMS connection factories and JMS  destinations (topic or queue) can be deployed on multiple members of a cluster.  Such distribution of JMS resources throughout a cluster will enhance both  load-balancing and fail-over of JMS services.<a name="idd1e41949"></a><a name="idd1e41954"></a><a name="idd1e41959"></a><a name="idd1e41964"></a></p>
<p><a name="ch15note06"></a></p>
<div class="docNote">
<p class="docNoteTitle">Note</p>
<p class="docText">J2EE doesn’t specify any rules for clustering Application  Servers, and left this feature to be offered by the J2EE application server  provider. Such added value is not part of the standard, but it provides  tremendous capability and a key differentiator to the application server when  deployed in production environments.</p>
</div>
<p><a name="ch15lev3sec1"></a></p>
<h5 class="docSection3Title">Load Balancing</h5>
<p class="docText">You can configure multiple Application Servers to share large  volumes of user requests. This is accomplished by using a proxy server (Web  server) to perform load balancing by distributing requests across the multiple  nodes in the tier behind it.<a name="idd1e41984"></a><a name="idd1e41989"></a></p>
<p><a name="ch15note07"></a></p>
<div class="docNote">
<p class="docNoteTitle">Note</p>
<p class="docText">The most commonly used proxy servers are Apache, Netscape, and  Microsoft Web server. The proxy server in this case affects the load balancing  of both the Web tier and the EJB tier.</p>
</div>
<p class="docText">In large enterprise applications, multiple proxy servers  (called a <em><a class="docLink" href="https://ejbvn.wordpress.com/category/week-3-advanced-ejb-applications/day-15-understanding-j2ee-architecture/0672324237_app05gloss01.html#app05gloss01entry335">Web server</a></em> <span class="docEmphasis">farm</span>) are used. The load on the proxy servers is  distributed by an external load balancer. The most common load balancer is from  Cisco.<a name="idd1e42014"></a></p>
<p><a name="ch15lev3sec2"></a></p>
<h5 class="docSection3Title">Failover and Replication</h5>
<p class="docText">Application Server provides session replication to ensure that  a client’s session state remains available. When the node managing the client  session fails, the proxy server sends subsequent requests to the replica in the  cluster. Session replication is done behind the scenes using the cluster  software.<a name="idd1e42024"></a><a name="idd1e42027"></a><a name="idd1e42030"></a><a name="idd1e42035"></a></p>
<p class="docText">Session replication can be either in-memory or persistent  replication. In-memory replication uses fewer resources and is more efficient  than persistent replication, which is the most commonly used. Persistence  replication writes the session data to a database; therefore, it’s far less  efficient and has a negative impact on the user’s response time.</p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title">Exploring J2EE Protocols</h3>
<p class="docText">Client applications connect with a J2EE Application Server  using standard networking protocols over TCP/IP. Application Server listens for  connection requests at a network address that can be specified as part of a  Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), which is a standardized string that specifies  a resource on a network, including the Internet.<a name="idd1e42059"></a><a name="idd1e42064"></a></p>
<p class="docText">Web-based clients communicate with Application Server using the  Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Java clients connect using the Java RMI,  which allows a Java client to execute objects in Application Server.  CORBA-enabled clients access Application Server RMI objects using RMI/IIOP,  which allows them to execute Application Server objects using standard CORBA  protocols.</p>
<p class="docText">The following sections summarize the protocols used by the J2EE  platform to transfer data between its multiple tiers.</p>
<p><a name="ch15lev2sec9"></a></p>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Transport Control Protocol over Internet  Protocol</h4>
<p class="docText">TCP/IP, or Transport Control Protocol (TCP) over Internet  Protocol (IP), provides reliable delivery of streams of data from one host to  another. IP is the basic protocol of the Internet, which enables the unreliable  delivery of packets from one host to another. IP makes no guarantees to deliver  packets, or that packets will arrive in the order in which they were sent. The  TCP adds the notions of connection and reliability, which are responsible for  the guaranteed delivery of packets.<a name="idd1e42121"></a><a name="idd1e42126"></a></p>
<p><a name="ch15lev2sec10"></a></p>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Hypertext Transfer Protocol</h4>
<p class="docText">HTTP is the Internet protocol used to transfer hypertext  objects from remote hosts to requesting clients. It is a generic, stateless,  object-oriented protocol that may be used for many similar tasks, such as DNS  and distributed object-oriented systems. HTTP messages consist of requests from  the client to the HTTP server, and responses from the server to the client.  Application Server always responds to an HTTP request by executing a servlet, a  JSP, or static HTML, which returns results to the client. An HTTP servlet is a  Java class that can access the contents of an HTTP request received over the  network and return an HTTP-compliant result to the client. You learned about  HTTP, JSP, and servlets on <a class="docLink" href="https://ejbvn.wordpress.com/category/week-3-advanced-ejb-applications/day-15-understanding-j2ee-architecture/0672324237_ch07.html#ch07">Day  7</a>.<a name="idd1e42177"></a><a name="idd1e42182"></a></p>
<p><a name="ch15lev2sec11"></a></p>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Secure Sockets Layer</h4>
<p class="docText">Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a security protocol that provides  privacy over the Internet. The protocol allows client/server applications to  communicate in a way that cannot be eavesdropped on or tampered with. Servers  are always authenticated, and clients are optionally authenticated. Data  exchanged with the HTTP protocol can be encrypted with the SSL protocol.<a name="idd1e42203"></a><a name="idd1e42208"></a><a name="idd1e42213"></a><a name="idd1e42218"></a></p>
<p><a name="ch15note08"></a></p>
<div class="docNote">
<p class="docNoteTitle">Note</p>
<p class="docText">Using SSL assures the client that it has connected with an  authenticated server and that data transmitted over the network is private.  You’ll learn more about SSL on <a class="docLink" href="https://ejbvn.wordpress.com/category/week-3-advanced-ejb-applications/day-15-understanding-j2ee-architecture/0672324237_ch19.html#ch19">Day 19</a>, “Understanding Security,” when we  study security for J2EE applications.</p>
</div>
<p><a name="ch15lev2sec12"></a></p>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Remote Method Invocation</h4>
<p class="docText">RMI is the standard Java facility for distributed applications.  RMI allows one Java program, called a <span class="docEmphasis">server</span>, to  publish Java objects that another Java program, called a <span class="docEmphasis">client</span>, can execute. In most applications, Application  Server is the RMI server and a Java client application is the client. But the  roles can be reversed; RMI allows any Java program to play the role of server.  You learned about RMI on <a class="docLink" href="https://ejbvn.wordpress.com/category/week-3-advanced-ejb-applications/day-15-understanding-j2ee-architecture/0672324237_ch02.html#ch02">Day  2</a>, “Understanding EJB Types and Interfaces.”<a name="idd1e42276"></a><a name="idd1e42281"></a></p>
<p><a name="ch15lev2sec13"></a></p>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">JavaIDL</h4>
<p class="docText">JavaIDL (Java Interface Definition Language) provides a  mechanism to Java clients in defining interfaces to access methods on CORBA  objects. JavaIDL consists of a collection of CORBA classes and interfaces. An  enterprise application developer uses the IDL compiler to generate code for a  Java client stub to access a CORBA object, which is defined by the IDL. The Java  client is then linked with the stub and uses the CORBA interfaces to access the  CORBA object.<a name="idd1e42314"></a><a name="idd1e42319"></a><a name="idd1e42324"></a></p>
<p><a name="ch15lev2sec14"></a></p>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">RMI/IIOP</h4>
<p class="docText">RMI/IIOP is basically a bridge between RMI (the Java native  protocol) and IIOP (the CORBA native protocol). IIOP is short for CORBA’s  Internet Inter-ORB Protocol. RMI/IIOP provides applications developer to write  remote interfaces in the Java programming language. The remote interface can  then be converted to IDL and implemented in any of the languages that are  supported by CORBA mapping and an Object Request Broker (ORB) for that language.  This mapping translates objects and primitive data types of one language to  CORBA-compliant data types.</p>
<p class="docText">Clients and servers can be written in any language using IDL  derived from the RMI interfaces. When remote interfaces are defined as Java RMI  interfaces, RMI over IIOP provides interoperability with CORBA objects  implemented in any language.</p>
<p class="docText">RMI is discussed in more details on <a class="docLink" href="https://ejbvn.wordpress.com/category/week-3-advanced-ejb-applications/day-15-understanding-j2ee-architecture/0672324237_ch02.html#ch02">Day 2</a>, “<a class="docLink" href="https://ejbvn.wordpress.com/category/week-3-advanced-ejb-applications/day-15-understanding-j2ee-architecture/0672324237_ch02.html#ch02">Understanding the Fundamentals of Enterprise  JavaBeans</a>.”</p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title">Understanding the J2EE Common Services APIs</h3>
<p class="docText">The J2EE architecture allows applications to access a wide  range of services in a uniform manner. This section describes the technologies  that provide access to infrastructure services such as databases, transactions,  XML processing, naming and directory services, and enterprise information  systems. As such, many J2EE APIs are available for use by developers and  management by Application Server. Those of particular interest are summarized in  the following sections.<a name="idd1e42427"></a><a name="idd1e42432"></a></p>
<p><a name="ch15lev2sec15"></a></p>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Java Naming and Directory Interface</h4>
<p class="docText">The Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) is an API that  provides applications with unified methods for performing standard naming and  directory services. JNDI standardizes access to directory services, such as  associating attributes with objects and searching for objects using their  attributes. With JNDI, an application can store and retrieve any named Java  object in a standard fashion. You learned about JNDI on <a class="docLink" href="https://ejbvn.wordpress.com/category/week-3-advanced-ejb-applications/day-15-understanding-j2ee-architecture/0672324237_ch04.html#ch04">Day 4</a>, “Using JNDI for Naming Services and  Components.”<a name="idd1e42465"></a><a name="idd1e42470"></a></p>

<h4 class="docSection2Title">Java Database Connectivity</h4>
<p class="docText">Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is an API that provides  database-independent connectivity between the J2EE platform and a wide range of  data sources. JDBC allows J2EE applications to connect to databases and perform  all required operations through a standard set of APIs.<a name="idd1e42491"></a><a name="idd1e42496"></a><a name="idd1e42501"></a> You learned about JDBC on <a class="docLink" href="https://ejbvn.wordpress.com/category/week-3-advanced-ejb-applications/day-15-understanding-j2ee-architecture/0672324237_ch09.html#ch09">Day 9</a>, “Using JDBC to Connect  to a Database.”</p>

<h4 class="docSection2Title">Java Message Service</h4>
<p class="docText">The JMS API allows J2EE applications to access enterprise  message-oriented middleware systems such as IBM’s MQ Series and TIBCO’s  Rendezvous. JMS messages contain well-defined information that describes  specific business actions.<a name="idd1e42598"></a><a name="idd1e42603"></a></p>
<p class="docText">Through the exchange of these messages, applications track the  progress of enterprise activities. The JMS API supports both point-to-point and  publish-subscribe styles of messaging. You learned about JMS on <a class="docLink" href="https://ejbvn.wordpress.com/category/week-3-advanced-ejb-applications/day-15-understanding-j2ee-architecture/0672324237_ch13.html#ch13">Day 13</a>, “Understanding JMS and  Message-Driven Beans.”</p>

<h4 class="docSection2Title">Java Authentication and Authorization Service</h4>
<p class="docText">The Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) API  provides security-checking mechanisms, such as authentication and authorization,  to J2EE applications. You’ll learn about JAAS on <a class="docLink" href="https://ejbvn.wordpress.com/category/week-3-advanced-ejb-applications/day-15-understanding-j2ee-architecture/0672324237_ch19.html#ch19">Day 19</a>.<a name="idd1e42646"></a><a name="idd1e42651"></a><a name="idd1e42656"></a><a name="idd1e42663"></a></p>

<h5 class="docSection3Title">JavaMail</h5>
<p class="docText">The JavaMail API provides a set of abstract classes and  interfaces that comprise an electronic mail system. The abstract classes and  interfaces support many different implementations of message stores, formats,  and transports. Many simple applications will need to interact with the  messaging system only through these base classes and interfaces.</p>
<p class="docText">The abstract classes in the JavaMail API can be subclassed to  provide new protocols and add functionality when necessary. In addition, the  JavaMail API includes concrete subclasses that implement widely used Internet  mail protocols and conform to specifications RFC822 and RFC2045. They are ready  to be used in application development. Developers can subclass JavaMail classes  to provide implementations of particular messaging systems, such as IMAP4  (Internet Message Access Protocol version 4), POP3 (Post Office Protocol version  3), and SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). You’ll learn about JavaMail on <a class="docLink" href="https://ejbvn.wordpress.com/category/week-3-advanced-ejb-applications/day-15-understanding-j2ee-architecture/0672324237_ch21.html#ch21">Day 21</a>, “Developing a  Complete Enterprise Application.”<a name="idd1e42696"></a><a name="idd1e42701"></a></p>

<h4 class="docSection2Title">JavaBeans Activation Framework</h4>
<p class="docText">The JavaBeans Activation Framework (JAF) API integrates support  for MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Exchange) data types into the Java  platform. JavaBeans components can be specified for operating on MIME data, such  as viewing or editing the data. The JAF API also provides a mechanism to map  filename extensions to MIME types.<a name="idd1e42734"></a><a name="idd1e42739"></a><a name="idd1e42744"></a><a name="idd1e42749"></a></p>
<p class="docText">The JAF API is required by the JavaMail API to handle the data  included in e-mail messages. Typical applications won’t need to use the JAF API  directly, although applications making sophisticated use of e-mail might need  it.</p>
<p><a name="ch15lev2sec23"></a></p>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Java Transaction API</h4>
<p class="docText">The Java Transaction API (JTA) specification allows  applications to perform distributed transactions independent of specific  implementations. JTA specifies standard Java interfaces between a transaction  manager and all participants involved in a distributed transaction. Such  participants are typically the J2EE application server, the resource managers,  and the application components sharing the transaction.<a name="idd1e42788"></a><a name="idd1e42793"></a><a name="idd1e42798"></a><a name="idd1e42803"></a><a name="idd1e42808"></a><a name="idd1e42813"></a><a name="idd1e42818"></a><a name="idd1e42823"></a> You’ll learn about JTA in <a class="docLink" href="https://ejbvn.wordpress.com/category/week-3-advanced-ejb-applications/day-15-understanding-j2ee-architecture/0672324237_ch16.html#ch16">Day 16</a>, “<a class="docLink" href="https://ejbvn.wordpress.com/category/week-3-advanced-ejb-applications/day-15-understanding-j2ee-architecture/0672324237_ch16.html#ch16">Understanding Transactions</a>.”</p>

<h4 class="docSection2Title">Java API for XML Parsing</h4>
<p class="docText">The Java API for XML Parsing (JAXP) technology provides  abstractions for XML parsers and transformation APIs. It supports the processing  of XML documents using the Document Object Model (DOM) and Extensible Stylesheet  Language Transformation (XSLT) transformations. JAXP enables applications to  parse and transform XML documents independent of a particular XML processing  implementation.<a name="idd1e42882"></a><a name="idd1e42887"></a></p>

<p class="docNoteTitle">Note</p>
<p class="docText">Web Services are new technology that allows applications to  communicate with each other over the Web. They typically communicate by passing  messages. The XML-based SOAP 1.1 protocol over HTTP transport is becoming a  popular and standard way exchanging messages between these applications. WSDL  (Web Services Description Language) can be used to describe abstractly a Web  service and can bind it to a network endpoint. EJB 2.1 is implementing Web  services using stateless session beans. Session beans define a Web service  interface and implements that interface in the bean class conforming to the  JAX-RPC rules. The interface is specified as a service endpoint in the  deployment descriptor. The session bean can get the SOAP message and the  properties using the <tt>MessageContext</tt> interface available from  <tt>SessionContext</tt> interface. From the client’s point of view, the session  bean is completely hidden behind the Web service endpoint. Java clients,  including all enterprise beans, can locate an endpoint using JNDI and accesses  the interface by means of the JAX-RPC API.</p>

<h4 class="docSection2Title">J2EE Connector Architecture</h4>
<p class="docText">The J2EE Connector Architecture (JCA) is a standard API for  connecting the J2EE platform to enterprise information systems (EIS), such as  enterprise resource planning (ERP), mainframe transaction processing, and  database systems. The architecture addresses the issues involved when  integrating existing EIS, such as SAP, CICS, legacy applications, and  nonrelational databases, with an EJB server and enterprise applications. The JCA  defines a set of scalable, secure, and transactional mechanisms for integrating  an EIS with a J2EE platform.<a name="idd1e42988"></a><a name="idd1e42993"></a><a name="idd1e42998"></a></p>
<p class="docText">The J2EE Connector Architecture is implemented both in  Application Server and in an EIS-specific resource adapter (RA). A resource  adapter is a system library specific to an EIS and provides an interface to the  EIS. A resource adapter is analogous to a JDBC driver. The interface between a  resource adapter and the EIS is specific to the underlying EIS, and can be a  native interface. The JCA comprises the system-level contracts between  Application Server and a given resource adaptor, a common interface for clients  to access the adaptor, and interfaces for packaging and deploying resource  adaptors to J2EE applications.</p>

<p class="docText">In EJB 2.1, EJB container provides timer services to enterprise  beans for scheduling business tasks based on time events. Both stateless session  beans and entity beans can utilize the timer services provided by the container.  The EJB container invokes the callback method of the enterprise bean at a  specified time or after a specified duration or in specified time intervals for  enterprise beans that register with the container. The timer method of an  enterprise bean implements the business logic to handle the timeout event. The  timer services, however, are not intended for modeling real-time events. The EJB  container provides reliable timer services that can survive container crashes,  activation/passivation, and load/store cycles of enterprise beans. Further the  containers manage timers that are part of transactions. The containers allow  enterprise beans to create, locate, and cancel timers.</p>

<h3 class="docSection1Title">Packaging J2EE Applications</h3>
<p class="docText">The J2EE platform simplifies the deployment of enterprise  applications. This is accomplished by packaging applications and components into  independent modules. Each module contains all the components along with a  deployment descriptor. The deployment descriptor, as its name implies, describes  each component’s properties, the relationship between components, and the  customized common services to be provided by the container at runtime.  Typically, all components of one tier are packaged into a separate module.<a name="idd1e43529"></a><a name="idd1e43534"></a><a name="idd1e43539"></a></p>
<p class="docText">A J2EE application consists of one or more J2EE modules and one  J2EE application deployment descriptor. An application deployment descriptor  contains a list of modules and how to configure them. A J2EE application is  represented by an EAR file, which must contain at least one JAR file. In  addition, an EAR file might contain any number of WAR files and RAR files, or  none at all (see <a class="docLink" href="https://ejbvn.wordpress.com/category/week-3-advanced-ejb-applications/day-15-understanding-j2ee-architecture/#ch15fig05">Figure 15.5</a>).

<h3 class="docSection1Title">Designing J2EE Applications</h3>
<p class="docText">In designing J2EE applications, care must be taken to avoid  many recurring problems, most of which are related to optimizing remote calls  between client and the requesting service. For example, fulfilling a request by  making one trip to the database is much more efficient than making several  trips. This enhances the network traffic and optimizes repeated resource  allocations. These recurring problems and issues in designing applications are  gathered and documented in a catalog of design patterns.<a name="idd1e43793"></a><a name="idd1e43798"></a><a name="idd1e43803"></a><a name="idd1e43808"></a><a name="idd1e43813"></a></p>
<p class="docText">Patterns are typically written in a structured format. A design  pattern is identified by a name, problem statement, and the solution to that  problem. Design patterns are developed to prevent reinventing the wheel;  therefore, they are reusable artifacts. They exist at different levels of  abstraction, and they communicate designs and best practices. In enterprise  applications, you can join design patterns together to solve a larger problem.<a name="idd1e43821"></a><a name="idd1e43826"></a></p>
<p class="docText">By now, you have already been introduced to the MVC design  pattern. Today, you’ll learn few more patterns that can be applied in designing  J2EE applications.</p>

<h4 class="docSection2Title">Session Façade Design Pattern</h4>
<p class="docText">The J2EE specification doesn’t restrict access to entity beans  by any client components. EJB clients, such as Java applications from the client  tier, and servlets and JSP from the Web tier, can have direct access to entity  beans. Access of entity beans directly over the network takes more remote calls  and imposes network overhead. Again, in minimizing remote calls, a session bean  can be used as a façade in the EJB tier to mediate access on behalf of the  client (see <a class="docLink" href="https://ejbvn.wordpress.com/category/week-3-advanced-ejb-applications/day-15-understanding-j2ee-architecture/#ch15fig06">Figure 15.6</a>).<a name="idd1e43871"></a><a name="idd1e43876"></a></p>
<h5 class="docFigureTitle"><a name="ch15fig06"></a>Figure 15.6. Session façade  pattern</h5>
<p class="docText"><a href="https://ejbvn.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/156.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="171" data-permalink="https://ejbvn.wordpress.com/2008/11/02/day-15-understanding-j2ee-architecture/attachment/156/" data-orig-file="https://ejbvn.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/156.jpg?w=529" data-orig-size="" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="[]" data-image-title="156" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://ejbvn.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/156.jpg?w=529?w=300" data-large-file="https://ejbvn.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/156.jpg?w=529?w=529" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-171" title="156" src="./Day 15. Understanding J2EE Architecture _ EJB In 21 Days __files/156.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p class="docText">An EJB client accesses the session bean (Façade) instead of  entity beans through a coarse-grained method call to accomplish a business  process. Wrapping entity beans with a Session Façade reduces network traffic,  which is reflected in positive performance.</p>
<p><a name="ch15lev2sec28"></a></p>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Service Locator Design Pattern</h4>
<p class="docText">The Service Locator pattern addresses the issue of the usage of  JNDI to look up different resources and services. These resources can be any of  the <tt>EJBHome</tt> objects, <tt>DataSource</tt> objects, or JMS  <tt>ConnectionFactory</tt> objects. Each lookup is an expensive remote call in  terms of network traffic. To minimize remote calls, a service locator object is  created locally to maintain a cache of these service objects (see <a class="docLink" href="https://ejbvn.wordpress.com/category/week-3-advanced-ejb-applications/day-15-understanding-j2ee-architecture/#ch15fig07">Figure 15.7</a>).<a name="idd1e43918"></a><a name="idd1e43921"></a></p>

<p class="docText"><a href="https://ejbvn.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/157.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="172" data-permalink="https://ejbvn.wordpress.com/2008/11/02/day-15-understanding-j2ee-architecture/attachment/157/" data-orig-file="https://ejbvn.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/157.jpg?w=529" data-orig-size="" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="[]" data-image-title="157" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://ejbvn.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/157.jpg?w=529?w=300" data-large-file="https://ejbvn.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/157.jpg?w=529?w=529" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-172" title="157" src="./Day 15. Understanding J2EE Architecture _ EJB In 21 Days __files/157.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p class="docText">Any lookup for a JNDI remote object is done only the first  time; subsequent lookups access the local cache of service objects.</p>
<p><a name="ch15lev2sec29"></a></p>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Message Façade Design Pattern</h4>
<p class="docText">Because methods of both session and entity beans are executed  synchronously, a client method call has to wait until a value is returned. Some  e-commerce applications, such as checking a customer’s credit, require waiting  for an approval before proceeding. Using synchronous session or entity beans in  such situations will not be efficient because the client has to wait for a  reply. This situation can be resolved by using a message-driven bean, waiting  for a reply, and delivering it to the client through an e-mail (see <a class="docLink" href="https://ejbvn.wordpress.com/category/week-3-advanced-ejb-applications/day-15-understanding-j2ee-architecture/#ch15fig08">Figure 15.8</a>).<a name="idd1e43950"></a><a name="idd1e43953"></a></p>

<p class="docText">Using message-driven beans implies the use of the JMS product,  which is assumed as part of the enterprise infrastructure.</p>
<p><a name="ch15lev2sec30"></a></p>
<h4 class="docSection2Title">Value Object Design Pattern</h4>
<p class="docText">The Value Object design pattern is used to transfer remote,  fine-grained data by sending a coarse-grained or bulk view of that data.<a name="idd1e43978"></a><a name="idd1e43981"></a></p>
<p><a name="ch15note14"></a></p>
<div class="docNote">
<p class="docNoteTitle">Note</p>
<p class="docText">We briefly discussed the concept of a <em><a class="docLink" href="https://ejbvn.wordpress.com/category/week-3-advanced-ejb-applications/day-15-understanding-j2ee-architecture/0672324237_app05gloss01.html#app05gloss01entry64">data bean</a></em>,  during the discussion of JavaBeans on <a class="docLink" href="https://ejbvn.wordpress.com/category/week-3-advanced-ejb-applications/day-15-understanding-j2ee-architecture/0672324237_ch07.html#ch07">Day 7</a>.

</div>
<p class="docText">The main advantage of this pattern is to make one trip to the  remote EJB tier, and bring a coarse-grained (bulky) object of data to the local  machine.

<h3 class="docSection1Title">Best Practices</h3>
<p class="docText">J2EE has many best practices applied to designing applications  and components. The main keys in them are the design patterns covered in the  previous section. Most best practices focus on minimizing remote calls, which  reduce network traffic and enhance the performance of your applications. Both  the Service Locator pattern and the Session Façade pattern address remote calls  by creating an object local to the service you’re trying to access. Caching is  another technique used to reduce network traffic in distributed  applications.</p>
<p class="docText">Not all solutions are synchronous; some elegant solutions use  an asynchronous messaging paradigm. Using message-driven beans to delivering  solutions in which clients do not have to wait for an immediate response is more  efficient.</p>
<p class="docText">J2EE best practices is a subject by itself, and requires more  study and architectural experience. Each component, application, and tier has  its own design considerations, which we try to cover across our journey of 21  days.</p>
<p class="docText">Clustering of services and components across multiple tiers has  great impact on the scalability and availability of your applications. Both load  balancing and failover are used in clustering technology to meet heavy load  situations.</p>
<h3 class="docSection1Title">Summary</h3>
<p class="docText">Today, you explored the J2EE platform and the rationale behind  its architecture. You learned about different type of containers and the common  services that are available for use by the components hosted in that container.  J2EE container is a runtime environment and provides several levels of  abstractions. You also learned a brief description of the common services  available in the J2EE platform. You recognized the J2EE modules necessary to  build and deploy J2EE applications. We covered some of the design patterns used  in the J2EE platform, such as the Session Façade and the Service Locator.</p>
